### Problem Statement

- Labor-intensive and time-consuming process.
- Many signals need to be collected at home, making it non-portable and requiring complicated device setups.

### Biosignal Analysis

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean up biosignals by removing noise and artifacts to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identify meaningful features from the signals, selected by experts for their relevance to sleep stage scoring.
3. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models on the extracted features to recognize patterns and associate them with different sleep stages (e.g., REM, NREM).

> Deep learning uses multiple layers of non-linear transformations to convert inputs into representations useful for subsequent tasks like classification.

### Sleep Stage Scoring

**NREM Sleep** is divided into three stages:
- **N1**: Lightest stage, characterized by slow eye movements and reduced muscle activity.
- **N2**: Deeper sleep with regular brain waves and decreased muscle activity.
- **N3**: Deepest stage, marked by very slow delta waves and absence of muscle activity.

**REM Sleep**: Characterized by rapid eye movements, increased brain activity, and muscle paralysis. Essential for memory consolidation and dreaming.

**Awake**: A fifth stage, characterized by the absence of sleep stages N1-REM, typically brief and occurring between sleep cycles.

**Sleep Stage Scoring** is a multi-class classification problem in machine learning with five classes: N1, N2, N3, REM, and Awake.

**Sleep Quality Metrics**:
- **Total Sleep Time (TST)**: Total minutes spent asleep.
- **Time in Bed (TIB)**: Total time spent in bed, including awake time.
- **Sleep Efficiency (%)**: Percentage of time spent in bed that is spent asleep.

### Model Comparison

| Feature               | DeepSleepNet       | TinySleepNet     |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Representation Learning| Two branches of CNNs | Single branch of CNNs with hierarchical structure |
| Sequence Learning      | Bidirectional RNNs  | Unidirectional RNNs |
| Data Augmentation      | Signal augmentation | Signal & sequence augmentation |
| Computational Resources | More               | Less             |
| Parameters             | More               | Fewer            |
| Performance            | Similar            | Similar          |
| Deployment             | More challenging   | Easier           |

### Evaluation

- **Experimental Setup**: k-fold cross-validation with non-overlapping patient split.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Overall: Accuracy (ACC), Macro-averaged F1-Score (MF1), Cohenâ€™s Kappa (Îº)
  - Per-class: Precision (PR), Recall (RE), F1-Score (F1)
- **Visualization**: Hypnogram for sleep stage progression.

### Conclusions

- Deep learning is mostly applied for supervised learning with biosignals, relying on labeled data to predict outcomes.
- Transforming raw signals into spectrograms or image representations allows using CNNs, though not always ideal for end-to-end training.
- Direct application of deep learning to raw signals is challenging but can work with sufficient data and clear patterns.
- Remote monitoring through wearable devices is a promising direction, adapting clinical models for real-world applications.
