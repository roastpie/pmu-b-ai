## ðŸ“Š Mental Disorder Detection from Social Media Data

> Predicting mental health disorders from social media data is aimed at identifying depression through posts on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other websites. The project focuses on:
> 1. Predicting depression from social media data by collecting information from platforms where people express their feelings and mental state.
> 2. Once accurate predictions are made, this data can be used to identify individuals at risk and provide appropriate support.

### Data Collection

#### Direct Participant Data Collection

- **Questionnaires:** Surveys delivered to participants to gather specific information about their experiences, conditions, or opinions.
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR):** Extracting relevant data from participants' medical records with their consent.

#### Social Media Data Aggregation

- **Keyword Search:** Identifying relevant data by searching public social media posts for specific keywords or phrases like "I was diagnosed with [condition name]".
- **Annotation:** Manually tagging or classifying extracted data to categorize and analyze it effectively.

#### Benefits and Considerations

- **Direct Participant Data**
  - **Pros:** Controlled data quality, targeted information gathering, participant consent, and ethical considerations.
  - **Cons:** Potential for response bias, time, and cost required to recruit and survey participants.

- **Social Media Data**
  - **Pros:** Large volume of data available, insights into real-world language and behavior, potential for cost-effectiveness.
  - **Cons:** Privacy concerns, data quality challenges due to ambiguity and misinformation, ethical considerations regarding non-consensual data collection.

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing

#### Feature Extraction

- This involves transforming raw text data into numerical representations that computers can understand.
- Techniques like **bag-of-words** (as shown in the example) analyze word frequency and create vectors for each document.
- Other tools like **LIWC** analyze linguistic features such as pronouns and emotional tones.
