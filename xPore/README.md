## ðŸ§¬ xPore: An AI-Powered App for Bioinformaticians

> Software to compare the nucleotide positions on RNA sequences, such as comparing cancer patient RNA with normal human RNA to identify molecular differences. This utilizes electrical signal data from a Nanopore sequencer, the first and only tool capable of efficiently sequencing RNA directly.

### Problem Statement

- Nanopore sequencing is a novel technology that can directly sequence RNA molecules.
- It measures raw electrical signal data at each nucleotide position along the RNA strand.
- This signal data contains information about RNA modifications like m6A methylation.
- The goal is to develop a computational method to accurately locate modified positions and quantify modification rates from nanopore data.

### Data Collection and Preparation

- Nanopore sequencing produces raw signal data in **FAST5** format.
- Basecalled sequence data is output in **FASTQ** format.
- A reference genome is provided in **FASTA** format.
- The data is preprocessed by aligning to the reference and aggregating into event-level data.
- Each event represents the raw signal for a k-mer in the original RNA sequence.

### Modeling

- A **Bayesian multi-sample Gaussian mixture model (GMM)** is used.
- It models the distribution of electrical signal levels at each genomic position.
- The **Expectation Maximization** algorithm is used to fit parameters of the GMM.
- Each position is modeled as a mixture of 2 Gaussians, representing unmodified and modified states.
- The model is trained on multiple samples together to improve statistical power.

### Evaluation

- The model achieves **86% AUC** on a held-out test set for detecting known m6A modifications.
- It provides interpretable modification rate estimates that closely match expected levels.
- It performs well on a variety of tissue types and cell lines.
- The model enables the discovery of differentially modified positions between conditions.

### Future Work

- Potential improvements, like an end-to-end model directly from raw signal data.
- Investigation of different model architectures, such as **deep autoencoders**.
- Extending the model to detect additional RNA modification types beyond m6A.
