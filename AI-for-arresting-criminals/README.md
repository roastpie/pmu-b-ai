### Problem Statement

**Old Solutions**

- Reliance on CCTV footage reviewed by security staff.
- Extensive network of over 15,000 cameras in the southern provinces.

**Problems Identified**

- **Big data storage:** Managing and analyzing vast amounts of CCTV footage is resource-intensive.
- **Chanthaburi Police Database:** Collecting and storing data on specific groups raises privacy concerns.
- **Databases of at-risk people and vehicles:** Potential for misuse and discriminatory practices.
- **Limited investigative tools:** Reliance on traditional methods like witness testimony and forensic evidence is time-consuming and may lack efficiency.

**Objectives for Improvement**

- **Enhanced police proficiency:** Train officers in using AI-powered tools for crime data analysis and investigation on smartphones.
- **Increased public confidence:** Implement AI-powered CCTV systems for transparent crime monitoring and evidence recording.
- **Real-time crime prevention:** Develop AI systems that alert police to suspicious individuals or vehicles through mobile devices connected to a central server.

**Challenges to Address**

- **System design:** Creating a robust and secure system for crime prevention using AI technology.
- **Modern investigative knowledge:** Integrating AI tools into existing investigative practices while ensuring ethical and responsible data handling.
- **Understanding criminal behavior:** Analyzing patterns and sequences of events to predict and prevent crime effectively.

### Methodology

1. **Detection:** AI algorithms continuously analyze data from stations to identify suspicious activity or known criminals.
2. **Tracking:** Once a target is detected, the system tracks its movements across different stations, creating a visual trail.
3. **Recognition:** AI algorithms compare detected individuals or vehicles with data in the database to determine their identity.
4. **Alerts:** If a match is found, an alert is sent to police officers with relevant information, such as location, direction of movement, and criminal history.
5. **Response:** Officers can then use this information to apprehend suspects efficiently.

### Conclusion

- **Boosting police efficiency:** AI tools on smartphones will equip officers to analyze crime data effectively, streamlining investigations and response times.
- **Enhancing crime prevention:** Intelligent CCTV systems powered by AI will provide real-time crime monitoring and evidence recording, fostering public trust in security measures.
- **Proactive intervention:** AI algorithms will analyze CCTV footage and other data sources to detect suspicious activities and send instant alerts to police mobile devices, enabling rapid response to potential threats.
