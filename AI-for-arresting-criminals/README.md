### Problem Statement

**Old Solutions:**
- Heavy reliance on CCTV footage reviewed by security staff.
- Over 15,000 cameras in southern provinces.

**Problems Identified:**
- **Big Data Storage:** Managing and analyzing vast CCTV footage is resource-intensive.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Collecting data on specific groups raises privacy issues.
- **Potential for Misuse:** Databases of at-risk people and vehicles could be misused, leading to discriminatory practices.
- **Limited Investigative Tools:** Relying on traditional methods like witness testimony and forensic evidence is time-consuming and inefficient.

**Objectives for Improvement:**
- **Enhanced Police Proficiency:** Train officers to use AI-powered tools on smartphones for crime analysis.
- **Increased Public Confidence:** Implement AI-powered CCTV for transparent crime monitoring.
- **Real-time Crime Prevention:** Develop AI systems to alert police to suspicious individuals or vehicles via mobile devices.

**Challenges to Address:**
- **System Design:** Develop a robust and secure system for crime prevention using AI.
- **Ethical Integration:** Integrate AI into investigative practices with careful attention to data handling and ethics.
- **Criminal Behavior Analysis:** Understand and predict criminal behavior through data analysis.

### Methodology

1. **Detection:** AI algorithms continuously analyze data to detect suspicious activity or known criminals.
2. **Tracking:** Once a target is detected, the system tracks its movements across different stations.
3. **Recognition:** AI compares detected individuals or vehicles with data in the database to identify them.
4. **Alerts:** If a match is found, an alert with relevant information (location, direction, criminal history) is sent to officers.
5. **Response:** Officers can use this information to apprehend suspects efficiently.

### Conclusion

- **Boosting Police Efficiency:** AI tools will help officers analyze crime data and streamline investigations.
- **Enhancing Crime Prevention:** Intelligent CCTV systems will provide real-time monitoring and evidence recording, improving public trust in security.
- **Proactive Intervention:** AI algorithms will detect suspicious activity and send instant alerts to police, enabling quick responses to potential threats.
